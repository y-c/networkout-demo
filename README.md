## 🎯 The Perfect Market Mismatch

### 🇨🇳 China: Massive Demand
- 📈 **$28.4B fitness market** growing 9.17% annually
- 🏢 **Educated urban professionals** in tier-1 cities
- 💰 **High disposable income** + English learning aspirations
- ❌ **Quality trainer shortage** - most are sales-focused

### 🇺🇸 US: Untapped Supply
- 🎓 **Millions of college students** with fitness knowledge
- 💵 **Need flexible income** to pay bills
- 🕐 **Available during Chinese evening** hours
- 🔓 **Undermonetized expertise** in fitness & sports science

### 💡 No platform connects these markets with cultural intelligence

## 🤖 Our Solution: Autonomous AI Agents
We built an AI-powered platform with three autonomous agents that work together:

### 1. **Intake Agent** 
- Analyzes user input in natural language (English/Chinese)
- Extracts fitness goals, dietary restrictions, and preferences
- Creates comprehensive user profile

### 2. **Matchmaking Agent**
- Matches based on cultural compatibility
- Considers language preferences, dietary understanding
- Ranks trainers by cultural awareness score

### 3. **Workout Planning Agent**
- Generates culturally-adapted workout plans
- Accommodates dietary restrictions (halal, vegetarian, etc.)
- Provides bilingual instructions when needed
