# 🏋️ NetworkOut: AI-Powered Cross-Cultural Fitness Networking

## 🎯 The Problem
Chinese fitness enthusiasts struggle to find culturally-aware US trainers who understand their specific needs, dietary preferences, and communication styles.

## 💡 Our Solution: Autonomous AI Agents
We built an AI-powered platform with three autonomous agents that work together:

### 🤖 Our Agent Workflow
1. **Intake Agent** 
   - Analyzes user input in natural language (English/Chinese)
   - Extracts fitness goals, dietary restrictions, and preferences
   - Creates comprehensive user profile

2. **Matchmaking Agent**
   - Matches based on cultural compatibility
   - Considers language preferences, dietary understanding
   - Ranks trainers by cultural awareness score

3. **Workout Planning Agent**
   - Generates culturally-adapted workout plans
   - Accommodates dietary restrictions (halal, vegetarian, etc.)
   - Provides bilingual instructions when needed

## 📊 Market Opportunity
- **4.7M** Chinese Americans in the US
- **$32B** US fitness industry
- **0** Current platforms with cultural intelligence
